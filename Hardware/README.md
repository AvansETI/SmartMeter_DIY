# SmartMeter Hardware

This directory contains all the versions we have created for this project. The hardware
is designed using KiCAD (https://www.kicad.org/) and the whole project is put on Git. It
is also possible to use the gerber files only to create your own version of the SmartMeter.

## Requirements

The hardware has been created with the following requirements:
1. It needs to be soldered by everyone!
2. All components should be through-the-whole.
3. The hardware will be provided as do-it-yourself kit.
4. It should support different type of SmartMeters P1-port with varying versions.

## Version 1

The first version of the SmartMeter. It contains some errors that neede to be fixed.

## Version 2

The second version fixed the errors.

## Version 2.1

This version supports the newest SmartMeter version. With this version is it possible to use
5V power from the SmartMeter. No need anymore to use an adapter. Furthermore, if you have an
electric vehicle, it can be connected to the hardware as well.

## Some notes

Make sure you use the newest version if you create your own version.
